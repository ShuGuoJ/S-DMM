# S-DMM
This is a code sample for the paper "Deep Metric Learning-Based Feature Embedding for Hyperspectral Image Classification"

# Tested with
Python 3.9

Pytorch 1.9.0  

CPU or GPU

# Run the S-DMM
Please set your parameters in train.py or test.py before runing them. 

To train, run:
```python
python train.py
``` 

To test, run:
```python
python test.py
```

# About datasets and checkpoints
The datasets is available in http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes

# Note
This is the code for the same-scene HSI classification; The code for cross-scene HSI classification is in https://github.com/szubing/ED-DMM-UDA
